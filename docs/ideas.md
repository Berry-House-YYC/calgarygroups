Hello :) please help me make a spec sheet for a website I want to make, and also get a better idea of what exactly I am doing as I have a couple of ideas. What should my tech solution be?

Essentially I want to be a wayfinder for groups in Calgary, such as clubs, grassroots initiatives/resources, activist groups, and maybe even arts/craft markets, etc. I got the idea because once you are out of school or university, it is a lot harder to find community, but yet I know of quite a few clubs that exist; I've just had to find them by chance or searching on various websites and social medias. I DO NOT THINK SOMETHING LIKE THIS ALREADY EXISTS; I AM FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH THE NONPROFIT/GRASSROOTS SECTOR.

I am leaning towards it being an actual somewhat aesthetically appealing website rather than like a spreadsheet or database, notably because I think it would be PRETTIER and have more appeal. I also want it to have SEO so it is findable for people who are looking for ways to get engaged. I want tags but am not yet set on how to categorize things, perhaps for type of initiative (e.g. club, activist group, resource, market), or for interest (e.g. sports/rec, arts, social impact, etc).

But then there are also factors like age range or applicable identity, which is why I feel like maybe this should be a database so you can filter by different factors depending on what kind of things you are looking for. I don't think I have to write anything super detailed or make a whole page for the specific group/org, just a short description about what they do. 

I also am considering having a calendar to showcase events but I know that could get super overwhelming and chaotic, and I don't want people to have to submit their events if they already have like a full calendar or something; I don't want there to be too many roadblocks like me having to APPROVE the events, it should just be automatic.I am thinking I would reach out to most of the groups and ask them to advertise the site or something to get word spread, as well as maybe some similar nonprofits or agencies or maybe local activists/influencers that serve as connectors. This is how I would get the word out.Ideally, the website is free (or low-cost) and easy enough to maintain (I do not have coding experience but my partner does; I just want to be able to keep things updated). Ideally it is ETHICAL.

I want to have a feedback or report incorrect information button (or at least an email) for people to contact in case I don't catch something.Also, I want to make a ko-fi I think if people want to donate a little for this volunteer project :) and so this would be added to the site as well.

Questions/Ideas (Claude)

* Need ideas for website name!! Must include Calgary or YYC (preferably Calgary) and be straightforward rather than too creative to ensure it has good SEO
* Could it be via Obsidian & Flowershow or would that not work? I am most familiar with this platform.
* I've thought about having a calgary discord or slack for changemaking/general activists and an activist calendar for protests or advocacy events; it would be cool to make a little intergenerational community of like sector-agnostic nonprofit professionals and/or simply youth who want to get involved and don't know where to start?? I think the YOUTH-specific (under 30??) basis is not as covered by organizations, but I don't want to limit people who want to do good by AGE necessarily
  * Probably also an opportunity here for newcomers but like maybe I could just partner with immigrant orgs to share these opps more.
* SHOULD I HAVE like, sub-sites for the different interests or should I throw em altogether?
  * I think arts markets are significantly different from regular clubs and grassroots groups, they're a little nicher. I could probably reference to this on the primary website though and be like "check out X if you are looking for X"
* MAYBE MAYBE eventually I have thought it would be so cool to be a Calgary Influencer but for like the nonprofit/social good sector, or like parks or just things that are not necessarily businesses, not necessarily sponsorships, just sharing things I like about the city, accessible places in the city, etc. Except I kind of hate reels and have no real camera/video skills or interest in setting this up. Maybe I would learn but that would be a big investment. Blogs are cool but who even cares anymore. (I guess i could do a blog page)
  * I am craving some way to add myself into the primary wayfinder webpage just because I have such a passion for community engagement and knowledge sharing, but I don't want it to be overly focused on me.
* Would ALSO be cool to do some kind of buddy system, sort of like a dating app but for people to commit to go to events togetherrrr which could also like increase attendance at said grassroots/nonprofit events?? Idk this is probably way too complicated to think about
* MAYBE there could be a "rating/reviews" section so people could submit anonymous comments or reviews similar to google maps/yelp, but most of these aren't ON google maps because they are small and might not have a specific location (ideally these would be submitted for review so there isn't just a bunch of random hate?? Idk.) Testimonial style??
  * Should they be reviewed by the clubs themselves?? Is this too much to think about or create?? Especially since there may not be enough traction to gather objective information about a website. Maybe shelve this; consider if the platform could add something like this LATER ON (and how that might be created)
* I might want to integrate larger nonprofits into the wayfinder if applicable, or mention in notes where it is relevant
  * (I have businesses and nonprofits that I really like the work of, or like uhhh favourite cafes but this is all mostly personal; I am not exactly an influencer or well known, but there are also cafes or businesses that support community activities that would be good to showcase. Could this be like a sponsored thing??)
  * Some smaller groups/grassroots-type things also have nonprofit status, yet don't get a ton of traction, and I don't necessarily want to leave them out just because they have some funding or status, but I would like to be able to somehow differentiate between them (tag?)

Featuring (Inclusion Criteria)

(I want this to be transparent on the About somewhere)

"Inclusion/exclusion criteria is subject to the site creator's preferences.

Recommend an org here \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"

* leftist/progressive/or politically neutral groups
* Is a collective/community/group/club; meet up in person or online
* Largely Calgary-based
* Largely grassroots-focused organizations, some smaller nonprofits/charities??
  * Probably unless they have particular "club" style / regular meet ups... like CDLI?? Or am I just too biased here?
    * Lowkey wanna make a blog of my fav non-grassroots orgs in the city lol 
* Low/no barrier to entry
  * Ideally state if there is a membership fee??
  * E.g. Calgary Stampede Showband is not something that would be featured
* Non-university based (they have their own directories!)
* Sole purpose is not to sell you a product or service
  * With a couple of exceptions - community-focused businesses/cafes/pro-bono offerings (some of them might just be site owner's bias okay but this will be TAGGED ACCORDINGLY if I am smart enough to do that)
    * Or we make a new directory?? news/media included?? I'm just excited about too many thingssssss
* Are active
  * Website up/social media page has been updated within 6 months, or got a response via email/contact
  * PLEASE CONTACT ME IF IT IS NOT

\*\*\* Sports/Cultural/Faith Orgs do not appear to have like a one-stop--shop unless it is categorized according to nonprofit status on like the CRA page... I think I will leave out official nonprofits FOR NOW to avoid the site being completely overcome?? 

\*\*\* Debating about grassroots poverty reduction groups/volunteer initiatives?? Idk this isn't really a social group, and YET I think it's important to have a resources section, so I feel like maybe this would be a different category? Volunteer or Activist-focused???

\*\*\* Arts orgs have their own directory for the most part with Calgary Arts Dev... but maybe I'll showcase the smaller ones??
