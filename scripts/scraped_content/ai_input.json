Our community is brought together by adults who simply want to have more play in their week. Play happens by having a bunch of people willing to embrace their inner child, be open to new friendships and get exercise (with a bit of competitive spirit). Our only ask to participate is an inclusive, open attitude that is welcoming to all types of people, athletic ability and care for how you show up to have fun. If you’re looking for an untraditional, semi structured way to meet people, exercise and just be a kid, Recess Calgary is the place. Come out once, twice a month or every week and be a part of our community. Hi! I'm Tyson, founder of the community Recess Calgary! I'm just another Calgarian with an idea to bring people together.

[…] There was nothing before. There has been nothing as good since.” How can such high praise be reconciled when The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is both one of the most beloved and one of the most controversial novels in American history? On Tuesday, November 18, Janet H. delivered a well-researched and passionate presentation on Mark Twain. Janet examined the man, the writer, and Huckleberry Finn’s lasting place in modern literature. Twain’s writings address the horrors and injustices of slavery, and Janet handled this sensitive subject with care and insight. After showing Conan O’Brien’s heartfelt acceptance speech for the Mark Twain award for American Humor, Janet admitted she knew little about the writer before her research—other than knowing he was funny.
