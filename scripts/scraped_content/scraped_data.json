We create spaces for connection, collaboration, professional growth and fun. In a world where non-profit work can often feel isolating and overwhelming, we believe in the power of community to uplift, inspire, and sustain the individuals and teams behind the mission. ​ ​The Social Sector Social Club is based in Calgary, Alberta. Gather Our gatherings bring non-profit professionals together in a casual, welcoming space where ideas spark, collaborations form, and support networks grow. Work in the non-profit/social impact sector is hard, stressful and daunting. It can often feel pretty lonely. These informal meet-ups remind us that we’re not in this work alone. Lead Leadership in the non-profit sector isn’t just about titles - it’s about action, influence, and the ability to inspire others. Our leadership lunches and development opportunities create space for emerging and established leaders to exchange ideas, navigate challenges, and grow together. Play Rest and joy are just as essential as hard work - but they're easily and often forgotten in our line of work. Our group activities offer a way to unwind, rediscover old and explore new hobbies, and bring more fun and friendship into your life. Because when we take care of ourselves and each other, we create a stronger, more sustainable sector. Learn The non-profit world is constantly evolving, and staying ahead requires knowledge, insight, and fresh perspectives. Through thought leadership, actionable advice, and shared resources, we help non-profit professionals uncover new ways to activate their communities, drive change, and hopefully, improve their wellbeing.

    "main_text": "Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons Ernest Hemingway famously claimed, “All modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called Huckleberry Finn . […] There was nothing before. There has been nothing as good since.” How can such high praise be reconciled when The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is both one of the most beloved and one of the most controversial novels in American history? On Tuesday, November 18, Janet H. delivered a well-researched and passionate presentation on Mark Twain. Janet examined the man, the writer, and Huckleberry Finn’s lasting place in modern literature. Twain’s writings address the horrors and injustices of slavery, and Janet handled this sensitive subject with care and insight. After showing Conan O’Brien’s heartfelt acceptance speech for the Mark Twain award for American Humor, Janet admitted she knew little about the writer before her research—other than knowing he was funny. She learned numerous autobiographies exist (“shouldn’t there be only one?”) and recommended The Autobiography of Mark Twain (1959), edited by Charles Neider. Mark Twain was born Samuel Langhorne Clemens in 1835 and spent his childhood along the Mississippi River in Hannibal, Missouri. Twain was adventurous, humorous, and empathetic by nature. Upon his father’s death, Twain lived a “Charles Dickens-type misery” as a printer’s apprentice. He later became a journeyman printer, a steamboat pilot, a Confederate soldier, and a newspaper reporter. Writing about fraud and corruption was dangerous, so he began using the pen name “Mark Twain” (a nautical term). His extensive travels through Europe, the Middle East, and Hawaii inspired his humorous and satirical travel writings. Twain married and had four children—only one living passed the age of thirty. While living in Hartford, Connecticut, Twain wrote many of his classics: The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876), The Prince and the Pauper (1881 ), Life on the Mississippi (1883), and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn ...",

The sun is shining. Nothing on the agenda this morning other than a nice sleep in. Annnnd then, my dogs start barking. And barking. And barking. And even some time in the back yard won't quiet them. Fine, we're off for a walk!! Luckily for my dogs (and my husband!), my morning grouch was calmed when we came across Bell's Bookstore Cafe, a delightful little coffee shop / bookstore only blocks away from our house. We were greeted by rows of books, a few little trinkets for sale and the smell of fresh baking. This place has it all. Friendly staff, great coffee and a surprisingly large selection of homemade treats (including gluten-free options!). Who can be unhappy any longer?! They also have a water dish and place to tie up your puppies just outside the door. These guys are even true to their posted operating hours - we arrived just after 8 and they were already open. Not always true with small businesses and early mornings. The surroundings are not super posh, but it is comfortable and you can tell it is loved by its owners and customers alike. I get the feeling that Bell's is fiercely supported by the local community, and I think that is great. Sure, the Starbucks and Phil & Sebastian's down the road have figured out how to perfect the same americano time after time. But this place feels like home, they make a damn good coffee and delicio...",

We provide a strong voice in support of sustainable housing growth. Calgary has a long history of affordability with seemingly limitless supply. Now, our housing advantage is disappearing, as prices rise and supply shrinks. Car-centric neighbourhoods and a sprawling footprint are adding to the social, economic and climate impacts. We need all types of homes, for all shapes and sizes of families , in all parts of the city. The housing crises of Toronto and Vancouver are on our doorstep. It’s time we stop limiting much-needed housing. Housing is a basic need and every Calgarian should have a safe place to call home. Let's work together to create and enforce strong policies to address the housing challenges we face now and in the future. We commit to bringing pro-housing voices to the forefront of public discourse. We can challenge the status quo and find real solutions to our housing crisis by: advocating for zoning reform legalizing a broader range of housing types mobilizing volunteer energy and working across political divides Get in touch.

We intend to speak up about injustice and keep our boots on the ground for direct action. We believe in and advocate for the rights, dignity, and autonomy of PWUD, sex workers, and street-involved folks. They are our community; WE are current, former, and/or the friends and family of PWUD, sex workers, and street-involved folks. “When we talk about harm reduction, we often reduce it to a public health framework, [one of] reducing risk. That’s harm reduction with a small ‘h-r’. Harm reduction is meeting people where they are but not leaving them there. But Harm Reduction with a capital ‘H’ and ‘R’—this is the movement, one that shifts resources and power to the people who are most vulnerable to structural violence. This includes: building community for and empowering directly impacted people, or “people who are not seen;” disruption; changing narratives; solidarity; and fighting for social justice.\" -Monique Tula WISH LIST Help secure some much needed items that we run out of often or are asked for frequently CONTRIBUTE TO COMMUNITY CARE SEE MORE",

Learn More Wasakamapiwak Collective presents Vessels Dec 4 to Jan 30, open to the public Thurs-Sat 11am-6pm Vessels is a group residency and art exhibition featuring twelve local Indigenous artists: Danielle Piper, Jasmine Piper, Chris Piper, Riel Starr, Matt Hiltermann, Amber Boyd, Jamie Rozema-Stinson, Hilary McDonnell, Brendan McDonnell, Patricia Grimwood, Pihêsiw Grimwood, and Sarah Whalen-Lunn . They will be exploring the theme of vessels in its many forms and meanings. From baskets and pots to shoes, bags, garments, drums, and animal hides, the artists interpret the vessel as both a physical container and a symbolic space for story, identity, and tradition. The exhibition invites visitors to experience how vessels hold not only materials but also memory, culture, and connection. Through diverse mediums and practices, the participating artists reflect on the ways vessels carry histories, sustain communities, and embody the living relationship between people and the land. The residency will conclude at the end of January with a closing gathering and group discussion, offering an opportunity to hear directly from the artists about their creative processes, experiences, and the stories behind their work. Vessels celebrates the continuity of Indigenous artistry and the many forms through which culture is carried forward. Upcoming events. Follow our journey.

For over 25 years, the Calgary Mountain Bike Alliance (CMBA) has been building and maintaining sustainable singletrack trails in Calgary and Kananaskis. We are committed to creating safe, world-class trails and skills parks. We strive to grow a passionate and involved mountain bike community. Donate Join Volunteer Trail Organization Social Jul 24, 2025 Join us at Calgary Cycle Southwood on Saturday, July 26 from 9 AM to 5 PM for their Trail Organization Social (they’re opening early just for members). Founded in 1996 to represent the growing community of mountain-bikers, the CMBA has been part of Calgary’s mountain biking scene for nearly 30 years. Always volunteer-driven, the focus has gradually evolved and shifted based on the needs of the time, volunteers’ interests and the opportunities and relationships that have been developed. Initial efforts were successful in securing the right of mountain bikers to use the informal and formal trails in Bowmont Park and Nose Hill, when a ban had been threatened. In the late 90’s and early 00’s, the focus shifted to trail maintenance and efforts to get a bike skills park built somewhere in Calgary. In time, as the CMBA’s relationships with the City and Province grew stronger, the focus moved away from advocacy toward trail-building and trail maintenance, working in collaboration with the land managers. Numerous trails were built or improved in areas across the city. The Ridgeback trail in Kananaskis was constructed by the CMBA in 2009-10 and upgraded in 2015. In 2016, the CMBA was finally successful in building Calgary’s first public mountain bike skills park in Fish Creek Provincial Park. On the heels of the new Alberta Trails Act (2022), a new trail development project was initiated in the Jumpingpound Creek area of Kananaskis and construction began in 2024.

It will be a space where we share, connect, heal, renew and celebrate Indigenous cultures. A place to protect Indigenous practices, languages, Elders’ wisdom and oral and written teachings among all nations and all our relations. We envision a place that is inclusive to all Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples, accessible and centrally located with indoor and outdoor ceremony space that is culturally and historically significant, close to the river. A Space of Healing “An Indigenous Gathering Place will be a space of healing. Those who have been disconnected from our culture and teachings will have a chance to find their way home through Ceremony.” —The Elders Knowledge Circle, Treaty 7 Territory DID YOU KNOW THAT CURRENTLY THERE ARE… 500+ Cultural and spiritual places in Calgary 0 Cultural and spiritual places in Calgary for Indigenous people Why the Indigenous Gathering Place is needed Indigenous Peoples have gathered to celebrate, learn, share, practice and heal for centuries. Calgary has the fifth largest urban Indigenous population in Canada and is the only large City in Canada without such a space. With over 500 places in the city devoted to cultures, gathering and spirituality, not one is specifically dedicated to Indigenous Peoples’ ceremonial practices. It’s time to change that.

The class is taught by Obi Egbuna Jr., a veteran African history teacher and children’s playwright with over 30 years of experience. The children learn about our history of resistance to oppression, African heroes and heroines, music from across the Pan-African world and world events from a Pan-African perspective. The focus is on Africans at home and abroad. Since this class is virtual, it is open to all children of African descent who are able to participate at 3PM MST (Calgary time). register Free Groceries program Our free groceries program provides fresh groceries to African families throughout Calgary on a monthly basis. We provide meat, dairy, produce, cleaning supplies, personal care items along with formula and diapers to families that need them. The purpose of this program is to build community by demonstrating that we can meet the needs of our people by working together. Home-cooked meals program Once a month, UAD organizers and volunteers prepare home-cooked meals and snack bags to distribute them to our houseless community members in the Calgary downtown area. Since the inception of this program in January 2022, over 1000 meals have been distributed to houseless community members. Community Learning Circles We host monthly virtual and in-person events to engage in collective learning because we recognize the importance of African people gathering to discuss the various issues that impact our community. We also recognize that no movement can be successful without the political education of the masses. All people of African descent are able to attend these events. support these programs Join ...",

We welcome all who self-identify as women, trans, non-binary or Two-Spirit. Our Land Acknowledgment WTEP – We’re Together Ending Poverty – wishes to acknowledge the land as a living being which sustains us and all life; and to acknowledge the Indigenous peoples and their ancestors who first lived on this land. The relationship of Indigenous people to this land is the basis of their cultures and traditionally has been one of stewardship and respect. In the spirit of truth and reconciliation we recognize that Eurocentric settler cultures rested on very different beliefs that led to the expropriation of Indigenous lands and the dispossession of the Indigenous peoples living here. It is with humility that we commit to working with others to redress oppression. We acknowledge the Mohkinstsis, Blackfoot for Calgary, exists on the traditional territory of the Niitsitapi or Blackfoot Confederacy, including the Kainai, Siksika, and Piikani.

After 19 years of leading APN, he is excited to be opening up a new chapter in his professional life. He will stay on to ease the transition for a new Executive Director and remains one of the many incredible members of this organization. On behalf of the Board and myself, we are grateful and honoured to have worked with Trevor on the programs and services that APN offers to Alberta’s playwrights. His thoughtful approach, his kindness to all who encountered him, has been inspirational. Many of us playwrights would not be where we are without Trevor’s guidance and abilities as a dramaturge but also as a coach and mentor. I personally have benefited from his advocacy for my work and cannot begin to thank him. All these great attributes, however, were always tempered by his incredible good humour and a lot of jokes that kept me laughing. I and the Board are excited and supportive of Trevor’s next move and can’t wait to see what is in store for him next. The posting for the position is available by clicking HERE . With thanks, Tereasa Maillie President, AP A Message from trevor… Stepping Down As we celebrated APN’s 40th Anniversary this year, I found that I became quite reflective. It has been my great honour to have been the Executive Director of this great organization since 2007. I had no idea that what started out as a short-term contract to help APN get through the 2006 PlayWorks INK Festival would turn into a 19-year tenure here. I have enjoyed every moment (even the challenging ones), every board meeting (even the challenging ones), and every interaction I’ve had with playwrights (even the challenging ones). I feel blessed that artists from across the province have entrusted APN and myself in the development of their work and their...",

The first club was chartered in 1922 in Toronto, Ontario. The Progress club is as much about service to the community as it is about building friendships with other Progress members across Canada. Our annual Regional and National conventions provide a fun and informative opportunity to connect with the larger Progress family. The Prairie Rose club is a small but strong group of ladies who enjoy the mix of service and social that being a member provides. Each chapter is able to select the charities they wish to work with and how they support them. Calgary Prairie Rose ladies make working in the community a priority. Our mandate is to support initiatives and organizations that help and promote women’s health and wellness. We are women helping women!

Miskanawah is a multi-service organization, offering programs and services in the areas of family support (ranging from prevention and early intervention to intervention), youth services, clinical and cultural mental health supports, crisis support, housing support, and cultural and ceremonial supports. Learn More What We Offer: Guided by Indigenous teachings, Miskanawah offers culturally based, supportive services to people in the Calgary area as they strengthen their circles of self, family, community, and culture. All Miskanawah programs and offerings are rooted in the concept of Wahkotiwin (Cree for 'living in relationship'). By working in alignment with Wahkotiwin, Miskanawah creates a stronger sense of community and inclusion, becoming more than an agency people can access or are referred to for services. Miskanawah becomes a community stream within itself, where those who choose to engage can Miskamaso (Cree for 'discover for yourself') a Wahkotiwin journey. The intent is to develop a sense of community for families in an environment of belonging and cultural safety, where the hopes and aspirations of individuals, families and children are encouraged and supported. Learn More Building Relatives: Guided by the traditional teachings embedded within Wahkotiwin (Cree Natural Law of interconnection and kinship), our relationships and connections with those we serve are the foundation for the services we provide. Today, Miskanawah's community and cultural offerings have grown beyond a Miskanawah specific strategy, to...",

We have a range of members: some make a significant portion of their income from writing, and others have no intention of ever publishing. Many members write speculative fiction, (sci-fi, fantasy, etc.) and we also have members writing other genres, poetry, screenplays, and non-fiction. We are queer- and disability-inclusive, as well as anti-racist. If you dislike being in progressive spaces, this is not the group for you. There are other writing groups in Calgary which may be a better fit. While writers make connections with each other in this group, this isn't a formal networking space. It is meant to be a comfortable environment to focus on writing, and connect with others who share a similar interest. We spend half of each meet up writing whatever we're currently working on, with a chunk at the start and end for conversation. The conversation is often writing focused, though not always.

Upcoming events 1 See all Sat, Dec 27 · 1:00 PM MST The Glass Bead Game, Hesse Central Library, 800 3 St SE, Calgary, AB, CA “The highest aim of the Game is the attainment of mindfulness and universal understanding.” Hermann Hesse’s The Glass Bead Game presents a visionary future in which an intellectual elite devotes itself to mastering a grand symbolic “game” that synthesizes music, mathematics, philosophy, and cultural history. The novel follows Joseph Knecht’s rise through the scholarly province of Castalia, exploring the tension between pure intellectual contemplation and the demands of lived experience. Philosophically, the novel examines the limits of abstraction , the responsibilities of the intellectual , the search for wholeness, and different stages of development . Hesse draws on Eastern mysticism, Platonic idealism, and the dichotomy between the contemplative and active life. Knecht’s journey becomes a critique of sterile intellectual perfection: understanding, he learns, must ultimately be embodied rather than isolated. Historically, Hesse wrote the novel during the rise of totalitarianism in Europe. The isolated, inward-looking world of Castalia can be read as both a refuge from and an evasion of social responsibility. The book questions whether intellectual culture has moral obligations beyond itself — a theme that resonated deeply in a time of global crisis. The novel is ~550 pages and w...",

    "main_text": "Purpose of the Hub The ASCN: Calgary Hub operates in partnership with Calgary Arts Development, Trico Changemakers Studio, and the International Centre of Art for Social Change. The primary mission of the Calgary Hub is to cultivate, promote, and nurture the field of art for social change and community-engaged arts in Calgary, harnessing its potential as a tool for driving social transformation. We connect a dynamic community of Mohkínstsis (Calgary) art for social change practitioners, community leaders, non-profit organizations, art-based groups, and individuals committed to social transformation using art-based practices. We come together to share stories, resources, and initiatives and build relationships to strengthen the Art for Social Change field. Together, we inspire social innovation through the power of art. How We Came to Be In the Fall of 2021, the Calgary Hub embarked on a journey to uncover the landscape of Art for Social Change (ASC) in Mohkínstsis/Calgary through an outreach and mapping project. Through this project, we wanted to find the practitioners Mohkínstsis who are using arts to inspire and catalyze social change. We explored who is doing the work, how the work is done, and what conditions enable or inhibit Art for Social Change in Calgary. Over three months, we engaged with over 190 artists, art administrators, and representatives from various organizations and communities. Our findings showed that the question of resources continues to be present for most practitioners, and more interesting was the apparent need for connection within the field. More often than not, practitioners highlighted the challenges of connecting with colleagues and sharing their artistic endeavours. This has since become the Calgary Hub's first objective: connecting and engaging ASC practitioners in Mohkínstsis.
