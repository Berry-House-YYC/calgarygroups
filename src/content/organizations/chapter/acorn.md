description: "ACORN (Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now) Canada is a multi-issue, membership-based community union of low- and moderate-income people. We believe that social and economic justice can best be achieved by building community power for change. Our members fight landlords and corporations through direct action. Our members also fight for new and improved laws to protect their rights. Each member has a vote, and only members speak for the organization and have the authority to set the policy and determine the tactics of each group."
