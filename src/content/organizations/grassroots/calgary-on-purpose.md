Calgary on Purpose is a group of volunteers seeking a more connected and compassionate community. We strengthen our civic and democratic culture in order for us to live well together by hosting events for Calgarians to get to know each other, working with artists to tell stories of the interesting and inspiring people of this city, and working with other organizations who care about helping us to trust and appreciate each other.

We are Calgarians filled with curiosity about, and affection for, the peoples who live here. While we do not all share the same hopes and dreams, we can – together – build a connected and caring community.
