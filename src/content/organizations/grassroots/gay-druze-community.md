The Gay Druze Community is a space for those born into the Druze faith and identify with the 2SLGBTQIA+ community. Established in 2019, we offer resources, a blog for members to share narratives through a Druze lens inspired by lived experiences, and a platform for queer Druze voices to be heard.

We provide support for our members, including assistance with relocation costs and medication for international members. We also maintain a curated list of organizations to help members connect with local resources.
