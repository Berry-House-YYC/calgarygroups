description: "Alberta Bike Swap is a community-focused non-profit organization dedicated to making cycling affordable, cyclists safe, and bikes accessible by putting on large-scale one day buy and/or sell and/ or donate bike swap events. Its primary goal is to provide a transparent marketplace where every bike is vetted for safety (safe to ride) and legitimacy (not stolen), while simultaneously promoting legitimate CAN-BIKE safe-cycling education and funding the rebuild of donated bicycles to their strategic alliances that play nicely together."

  <strong>Notes:</strong>
  <p>We are an bicycle buy and/or sell and/or donate event on the first Saturday in May in Calgary; the event if run by volunteers and all the background work is done by its co-founders. We were founded in 2011 and are supported by the police, RCMP, Bike Index, and Project 529, and over 90 groups that play nicely together. We are a conduit for donated bikes year round across Alberta. CAN-BIKE is the only recognized and standardized cycling education program in Canada and there are only 4 CAN-BIKE Instructors in Alberta, one of the the founders is a CAN-BIKE Master Instructor. Being enthusiastic, but not qualified where your life depends on it might not be a great choice.</p>
