"At the core of our Wellness Centre programs is Family Violence Prevention. Niitoiyis Family Support Society works to stop family violence and all abuse. We provide the necessary support to help our clients find security, and finally, our ultimate goal, is to guide affected people to empower change in their own lives."

They operate as a shelter for victims of domestic violence, with programs supporting women and children. They also have support services for navigating the legal system, housing, and other governmental services, and provide various forms of cultural healing supports, such as counselling and Elder-led healing circles.
