Rainbow Garden Society operates a community garden focused on creating an inclusive, welcoming space for all community members. We host regular education events and meet weekly to maintain and develop our gardens.

Our garden is a sober space and fully transit-accessible, making it easy for anyone in Calgary to participate in gardening, learn about sustainable food practices, and connect with our community.
