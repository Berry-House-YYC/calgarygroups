Friends of Chinatown is a group of dedicated volunteers whose passion is sharing the history, growth, and culture of Chinatown in Calgary. Since 2016, we've been volunteering to celebrate and preserve this 100+ year old neighborhood. We host a variety of programs and events including historic chinatown tours, dim sum lunch tours, badminton meet-ups, outdoor hotpot nights, movie clubs, and fundraisers.

Our programs highlight the unique culture and history of Chinatown, support local Asian entrepreneurs and writers through our Moonlight Books and Gifts retail shop, and offer affordable community workshops including ceramic/clay classes. We also offer youth engagement through photo walk programs and community celebration events.
