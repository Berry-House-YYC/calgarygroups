The Southern Alberta Breasties brings together young people at all stages of their breast cancer experience wishing to connect and find support. We're committed to friendship and empathy, encourage questions, dialogue, and discussion, and strive to offer a safe place for young people to feel supported by peers who truly understand. As an informal support group, members are encouraged to connect with each other, set up coffee dates, host activities, and offer suggestions on how to make this group even more amazing.

This is a group for young people, as we are underserved in the cancer community. Please feel free to join us if you are in your 20s, 30s and 40s!
