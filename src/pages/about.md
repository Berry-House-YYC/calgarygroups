    <p>Welcome to Calgary Groups! We're a community-driven directory dedicated to helping Calgarians discover and connect with the amazing grassroots organizations, clubs, activist groups, and community initiatives that make our city special. We believe that finding your community shouldn't be a treasure hunt - it should be as simple as a click away.</p>
    
    <h2>Why we created this</h2>

    <p>Calgary is bursting with community energy! But we noticed something frustrating - all these incredible groups were scattered across dozens of platforms: Instagram posts, Facebook Groups, old websites, community newsletters, and mostly word-of-mouth. This fragmentation makes it harder for people to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>discover groups that match their values and interests</li>
      <li>find where/when things happen</li>
      <li>share reliable links with friends</li>
      <li>keep a community resource up-to-date over time</li>
    </ul>

    <p>That's why we built Calgary Groups - to be a warm, welcoming "public square" where all of Calgary's community energy can gather in one place. We wanted to create something that's:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Searchable</strong>: you can filter by type and interests.</li>
      <li><strong>Fast & accessible</strong>: static site, minimal dependencies, readable on any device.</li>
      <li><strong>Community-editable</strong>: listings live as plain text files in the repo.</li>
      <li><strong>Platform-independent</strong>: not locked inside a social network or proprietary tool.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How it works</h2>

    <p>It's beautifully simple! Each organization listing lives as a Markdown file right in this repository (under <code>src/content/organizations/</code>). The site is built with Eleventy and styled with Tailwind CSS - modern, fast, and accessible to everyone.</p>

    <h2>Add or update a listing</h2>

    <p><strong>Share a group with the community:</strong> Use our friendly <a href="/submit/">submission form</a> to tell us about a group.</p>
    <p><strong>Fix something that's not quite right:</strong> Open a GitHub issue or submit a pull request - every correction helps!</p>

    <p>We strive to keep all listings factual and linked to official sources. If you spot something that seems off, please flag it - community eyes make this resource better for everyone.</p>
