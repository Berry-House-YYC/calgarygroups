## Why this exists

Calgary Groups is a centralized directory to help Calgarians find grassroots organizations, clubs, activist groups, and community initiatives.

## How it works

Each organization is stored as a markdown file in this repository. The site is built as a static site for speed, accessibility, and long-term maintainability.
